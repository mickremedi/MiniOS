What file format is used for this binary? And what architecture is it compiled for?
    file format elf64-x86-64
    architecture: i386:x86-64

What are some of the names of segment/sections you find?
    .fini
    .init
    .eh_frame

What segment/section contains main (the function) and what is the address of main? 
    section: .text
    address: 00000000004007a2

Do you see the stack segment anywhere? What about the heap?
    No I can't see them anywhere. I believe the stack and heap aren't actually allocated
    until the program runs.
