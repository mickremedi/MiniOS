Which of the addresses from the output of
running ./map are defined in the executable, and which segment/section is each defined in?
    _main, recur and static data are defined in the exectutable. 
    main and recur can be found in .text
    static data can be found in .data

Make a list of the important segments, and what they are used for:
    .text: Text segment contains machine code of the compiled program.
    .bss: Data in this segment is initialized to arithmetic 0 before the program starts executing.
    Heap: the segment where dynamic memory allocation usually takes place. When some more memory 
        need to be allocated using malloc and calloc function, heap grows upward.
    Stack: Stack segment is used to store all local variables and is used for passing arguments to 
        the functions along with the return address of the instruction which is to be executed after 
        the function call is over.

What direction is the stack growing in?
    Downwards

How large is the stack frame for each recursive call?
    48 bytes ( 3 * 16 bytes)

Where is the heap? What direction is it growing in?
    Direction: upward
    Address: 0x1d60010

Are the two malloc()ed memory areas contiguous?
    No, theres a 12byte space between them since we malloced 100 but the difference is 0x70.
